On a cold evening, ***Climber*** was exhausted from venturing through freezing alleyways and dimly lit roads. Even though he was a mannequin, he could practically feel the unwelcoming breeze through his fabricated skin underneath all the layers he's wearing from his tracksuit. He also had this weird feeling that he was being **watched**, *somewhere... Someone* that he couldn't see. **His vision** isn't the greatest.

It's amazing how a smile really does change his whole appearance.

***" . . . When did you get here ? "*** The mannequin spoke gently, his tone concerned and subtly interested.
